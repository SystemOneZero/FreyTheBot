A javascript based speech recog llm discord bot.

Project is currently being built...

Changelog 1.1

old methods<br>
!join used to join the channel you want it to listen in.<br>
!disc used to make it leave voicechannel.

Added three methods that run currently to test it out a bit.

!gpt -- generates the prompt sent to gpt takes a user input after the command. example : !gpt what is a dog<br>
!savegpt -- saves the prompt locally<br>
!test -- plays the prompt via discord<br>

These are tempoary and only serve as proof of concept atm.
